for i in range(0,50):
    if((i%2)!=0) and ((i%3)!=0):
        print(i)

2.This is a Python Program to Check if a Number is a Palindrome

num=list(input())
if(num==num[::-1]):
    print("palindrome")
else:
    print("not palindrome")

3.This is a Python Program to read a number n and print the number of digits in it

4.This is a Python Program to read a number n and print and compute the series “1+2+…+n=”.
Problem Description
The program takes a number n and prints and computes the series “1+2+…+n=”.

num=int(input())
print((num*(num+1)/2))

5. Given an array A of size N where the array elements contain values from 1 to N with duplicates, the task is to find total number of subarrays which start and end with the same element.

a=list(input())
print(len(a)+(len(a)-(len(set(a)))))
